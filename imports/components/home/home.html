					This more serious project is a fast and extensible shooter entity component game engine, version 2 of the original shooter engine which is now deprecated. It is a complete port from hxsl to glsl, which means now the game can be compiled to mobile platforms and Windows/OSX/Linux just by using a different command.

					This is an Android app that was inspired by our constant needs as students to run out and get food. Instead of going alone, you use this Tinder-like app to hit up a friend. The real-time matchmaking algorithm is a simplistic version of what multiplayer online games use, accounting for distance and food preference. Made in Meteor.js.

					I only have a screenshot for the project, I temporarily cannot find the project.
