The site itself can be found [here](https://oxu.design/#/home).

My website uses Meteor.js and Angular.js. It includes a web version of my resume as well as ways to get in touch with me.

I'm still in the processes of adding more information such as biography, art, and other sections.

It is hosted on DigitalOcean with a low cost plan so aggressive access may cause overload.
Total cost to get it up was :
```
    10$ ........(2 month webserver on digital ocean)
    11$ ........(SSL certificate)
 +  9$  ........(oxu.design domain name)
----------------------------------------------------
    30$ ........(Canadian dollars)
```

Errors on the website? Send me a message and I will thank you with hugs and favors and fix it ASAP.
